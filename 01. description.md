Thanks to the module, the company can now offer public media services to its customers based on Emby accounts with added flexibility.

The module facilitates the creation of customer accounts on a pre-prepared Emby server. Now, it empowers users to define and manage multiple media accounts, allowing for more tailored offerings and increased customer satisfaction. Each account corresponds to a selected package, enabling customers to access varied media content at different price points. Notably, clients can now possess multiple independent media accounts, broadening their media access options.

Moreover, the module seamlessly integrates with Emby Connect functionality, enabling users to access their media accounts across different devices and platforms with ease.

For seamless operation, the module leverages Emby API to manage client accounts, ensuring efficient account creation and management processes.

We've meticulously crafted an installation manual for the module, encompassing all necessary steps, from preparing the Emby server to configuring PHP, Emby, SSL certificates, and more.
